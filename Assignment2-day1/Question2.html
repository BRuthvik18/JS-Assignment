        ->Var is a variable where SCOPE of that variable is global,that can be accessed through out the code,it is also caleed as FUNCTION SCOPED 
    </h2>
    <h2>
        ->if a variable is declared inside a function then it can be accessed  only within the function
    </h2>
    <h2>
        ->Variables can be re declared and updated
    </h2>
    <h2>
        ->The problem with variable is ,it causes a lot of bugs
        </h2>
        <h2>
        -> let is a blocked scope,So when a variable declared in a block,the variable is limited to be accssed in only that block
        </h2>
    </h2>
              ->Let can be UPDATED but not RE-DECLARED,If the variable is defined in different scopes there will be no error.
        <h2>
        ->Let is a better choice than var because it does not cause a problem.
        </h2>
        <h2>
        ->You don't have to worry about the variable which was declared as let in the previous block.
        </h2>
        <h2>
        CONST
